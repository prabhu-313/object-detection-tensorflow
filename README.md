# Object Detection Using TensorFlow on Kaggle Dataset 🚗

## 📌 Overview
This project implements an **Object Detection pipeline** using **TensorFlow** with a custom Kaggle dataset focusing on vehicle images. The solution applies **transfer learning** using MobileNetV2 and includes a complete pipeline from dataset preparation to model training and evaluation.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Automatic Kaggle dataset download via API.
- ✅ Image loading and preprocessing pipeline.
- ✅ Custom CNN and MobileNetV2 Transfer Learning architecture.
- ✅ Training with early stopping, learning rate scheduler, and model checkpointing.
- ✅ Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall.
- ✅ Visualizations of model predictions and training performance.

## 🖼️ Dataset
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle: [Car Object Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/car-object-detection)
- Includes labeled vehicle images with bounding box annotations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Kaggle API, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
